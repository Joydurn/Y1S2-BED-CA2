Hi cher, heres how to setup my back and frontend.
1. Open up SP_IT.sql with MySQL workbench  and initialise the sp_it schema
2. If necesary, change sql password in backend/model/databaseConfig.js to yours
3. Using VS Code or Windows Terminal, use 'nodemon server.js' in backend folder to initialise the backend server.
4. Do the same with 'nodemon FEserver.js in frontend folder to initalise frontend server.
5. Now, when you visit http://localhost:3001/ my website should show up

For logging in purposes, the 2 users 'Custa Mah' and 'Amin Nik Strater'
(customer and admin respectively) are avaliable to use for testing purposes.
both passwords are 'password' for your convenience

Thank you, if any technical difficulties feel free to contact me at 8828 8954 :)
